		<p>In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means thelogarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases thelogarithm counts repeated multiplication.</p>
		<p>logarithms were never really hard for me. I caught on pretty quick and understand it so far.</p>
