		<h1>Logarithm’s Reflection</h1>
		<p>I learn that logarithm will always relate to exponents.For example 4 to third power equal 64 which would be a logarithm.To get log, you would have to use the logarith formula.Once you have the logarithm formul solve you can solve log probles easily. </p>
		<p>For example : log5 125=3 to solve this in exponent form, which would be 5 to the third power which equals 125.Log basically just try to switch up equations with exponents. After you get the hang of it you would convert it back to exponent form.</p>
		<p>In the end logarithm formula is a good formula to try out and it a challenge and I like the challenge.“</p>
