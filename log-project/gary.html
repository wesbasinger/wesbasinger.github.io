		<h1>Logarithm Solving</h1>
		<p>A Logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number.</p>
		<p>An example is “How many 2s do we multiply to get 8?” 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so we needed to multiply 3 of the 2s to get 8, so the answer is 3.</p>
