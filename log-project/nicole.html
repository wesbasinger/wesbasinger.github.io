		<h1>Logarithms</h1>
		<p>Logarithms are not are hard as they seem. All you really have to do is just put them into the calculator and it just gives you the answer. There is nothing really that special to Logs. </p>
		<p>All a log is, is representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.Its really not that hard. Its a very simple processes. </p>
		<p>In the end all you need to really know is just how to put stuff in the calculator and thatâ€™s really all. </p>
