		<h1>How to solve Logarithms </h1>
		<p>What is a Logarithm? A Logarithm is a quantity representing the power of which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number. </p>
		<p>An example of this would be, 2^5, this would equal 32. The log of this problem would be log2 16=5.</p>
		<p>You can also solve this problem backwards by, log2 16=5 and this equals 2^5.</p>
