		<p>There are multiple ways that you can solve for these equations, ro example: two to the third power equals eight. You would change the log by making it log base two of eight is equal to three.p>
		<p>You can also do it backwards starting with the logarithm form. Let’s say you start from log4 16=2. It’s saying that 4^2 equals to 16</p>
		<p>You can also have an equation with a negative exponent which basically just makes the whole thing a fraction.</p>
