		<h1> From the beginning </h1>
		<p> We started logarithms with learning how to move the exponents. Like 103=1,000 putting it in logarithmic format is log 1000=3. The reason why I didn’t put ten in the equation is because it is called a common log meaning that if the base isn’t shown then the number is ten. Another example with the base shown would be 43=64 the logarithmic format is .</p>
		<p>Once we could get the hang of putting the equations in logarithmic format. We moved on to having missing numbers in the format. So we had to find the missing number. Such as 5x=25 the answer would be two because five times five equals twenty-five.</p>
