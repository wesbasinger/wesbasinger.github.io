		<h1>How to solve logarithm</h1>
		<p>The definition of logarithm is a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number</p>
		<p>For an example, 4^2 would equal 16. So the logarithm would be log4 16=2. It’s basically saying that 4 times 4 is equal to 16.</p>
		<p>You can also do it backwards starting with the logarithm form. Let’s say you start from log4 16=2. It’s saying that 4^2 equals to 16</p>
