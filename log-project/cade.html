		<h1>Logs and Exponent evaluation</h1>
		<p>A “Log” is simply putting an exponential equation into a different form that is supposed to make it abbreviated. For example, 10^3=x would be arranged like Log10^x=2.</p>
		<p>An exponent is a little number that is connected to another number and represents how many times that the other number is multiplied by itself.</p>
		<p>These two mathematical expressions are actually very important to Algebra, especially Exponents. THey are a very easy and quick way to show what they show.</p>
