                <p class="lead">At first you might think logarithms are hard to understand, but after awhile you will get the hang of it. Logarithms are a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number or the base, must be raised to produce a given number.  An important thing to know is logs ALWAYS relate back to exponents.</p>
                <p>An example would be, two to the third power equals eight. You would change it into a log by making it; log base two of eight is equal to three.</p>
                <p>There is also a logarithm known as the common log where it has a base of ten. When you have a common log you don’t have to write the base, because it is already known that there is an imaginary ten is there. If you have ten to the third power equals ten it will change to log one thousand equals 3.</p>
                <p>Fractions might come into play, which might scare you into thinking that it’s going to be really difficult to solve. In reality you can solve them into the same way, you just have to get used to the idea of it. </p>

                  <blockquote>”You could probably prove, by judicious use of logarithms and congruent triangles, that real life is a lot more like soap opera than most people will admit.” - Molly Ivins                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="lead">Logarithms may seem difficult at first, but with a little patience and practice you can get the hang of it in no time. If you are having a difficult time trying to remember what goes where, you can come up with a rhyme or saying to help you remember.</p>
