		<h1>Learning of Logs</h1>
		<p>When I first heard about logs I thought it would be hard. Then I learned that it is very easy.</p>
		<p>Going step by step and having a plan is much easier than trying to rush the equation.</p>
		<p>First you take the equation and break it apart. You would put log and make the first number the exponent then the number that was behind the equal sign before it and then after the equal sign the original exponent. Ex. 10^2=20 log10 20=2</p>
