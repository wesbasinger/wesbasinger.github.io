		<h1> Logarithm is one of the easiest concepts to understand in Algebra 2.</h1>
		<p>WHEN WE ARE GIVEN- the base 2, for example, and exponent 3, then we can evaluate 23. 23 = 8. Inversely, if we are given the base 2 and its power 8 -- 2? = 8 -- then what is the exponent that will produce 8? That exponent is called a logarithm. We call the exponent 3 the logarithm of 8 with base 2. We write 3 = log28.</p>
