		<h1>Logs Can Be Fun And Easy</h1>
		<p>Logs is the short way to say logarithm. The definition of a logarithm is  the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number.  For example, the base ten logarithm of 100 is 2, because ten raised to the power of two is 100: log 100 = 2.</p>
		<p>I think of logs as a new way to write exponents. For reference, 2^3=8 the logarithmic form is log2 8=3. So all you do is move the numbers around. You can also do it backwards let’s say I have log5 25=2 I can move the numbers and get its basic form which is 5^2=25.Logs can be easy and fun once you understand how to do them.</p>
