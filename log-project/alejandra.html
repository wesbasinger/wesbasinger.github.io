		<h1>Trying something new</h1>
		<p>When my teacher began to talk about about the new unit that we were covering, I was wary because I haven’t always had the best experiences in math class. I put my fears aside and figured that a new subject wouldn’t hurt me. My eyes were opened to a subject that I had previous experience in but also was able to expand on the subject.</p>
		<p> Exponents were something that I had knowledge from because of Algebra II and I felt comfortable in reviewing them. Being able to use a calculator really cut out the middleman for me and I was able to complete equations very quickly. This was not a difficult topic for me personally and I was able to focus on other math areas.</p>
		<p>Logarithms were very simple for me to comprehend because it was basically rearranging numbers into a different format. It was great because I didn’t struggle in advancing into different forms of logarithms. As someone who struggles in math, this was a big thing for me. I hope to be able to understand things like that again.</p>
