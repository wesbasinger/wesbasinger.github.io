		<p>A logarithm is a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number. To solve a logarithmic equation, rewrite the equation in exponential form and solve for the variable.To check your answer You could graph the function Ln(x)-8 and see where it crosses the x-axis. If you are correct, the graph should cross the x-axis at the answer you derived algebraically.</p>
		<p>My first steps in using Logs was a bit of a process. I thought that it would be a lot harder than it actually is...but I was told that those were only the basics of the lesson. Iâ€™m looking forward to actually knowing how hard this can get.</p>
		<p>As I look forward,I want to focus on what I am going to do for my next step when I actually am introduced to the more challenging portion of the lesson. </p>
