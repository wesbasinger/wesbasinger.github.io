		<h1>Logarithms and Exponents</h1>
		<p> The logarithm is the inverse operation to the exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to another fixed value, the base, must be raised to make that number. It it used in Algebra 2,to find the exponent when it is just a variable and not a number.</p>
		<p>There are many ways to solve for an exponent or a missing number in the equation if it has an exponent. There are the ones where the exponent is missing and you use log(#)/log(#), the first log will always be the number on the right side of the equal sign.</p>
		<p>The three others are easier than the one I just talked about. The easiest is where you have the exponent and the number with the exponent and then you have to find that number or answer to it. The second easiest one to me is where you are missing the number with the exponent but you have the exponent. All you do is take the reciprocal of the exponent and use it with the number on the right side of the equal sign and all you do is just solve.The third and last one is when you have a negative exponent and you are missing the number that is with the exponent. The number to the right of the equal sign turns into a fraction which will just be itself with a one over it. Then the negative exponent turns positive and goes with the denominator and then you solve and it will always have a one over it.</p>
