		<h1>My experience with log and exponents  </h1>
		<p>Working with exponents was a very easy topic for me. I worked with exponents before, and the process was very familiar.  </p>
		<p>Next, was my experience with log. It was a lot more challenging because it was my first time learning about this topic. After some practice and in depth explanations about it, I was able to grasp the concept in no time!</p>
		<p>Overall, my experience with these two topics went very well. I was able to add two more math concepts to my skill set. </p>
