		<h1>My Sophomore Year </h1>
		<p>This year has been pretty memorable. There isn’t really anything I regret doing and there isn’t anything that I would have rather done. So therefore, the year was all-in-all a great year. The teachers were great, the student body is fun to be with, and the overall experience was really good. </p>
		<p>I would say that ur Pol at Christmas was amazing and that seemed like what kicked off the year. However that is what we started on for our first forge project. But our forge classes this year are amazing. I love how much time we get to spend in forge. It is definitely worth it. I may not be advanced in all the forge classes, but I like how the teachers are willing to help you.</p>
		<p>Our athletics this year were the best. Champions in basketball, pretty good in baseball, and soccer is yet to come. Who knows where we are going, but better things have yet to come. Sports at VT is so fun. The kids are all energetic and so proud of their team and it just makes the experience that much better.</p>
