                <p>
                  I've noticed that my students on occasion will try to guess the originating
                  user of each tweet on a timeline.  Through my most recent foibles, I had created
                  a Python app that hit my home timeline, filtered only my students and returned some
                  JSON.  I had been wanting to work with React again, so I refactored everything into
                  Javascript and built a nice little front end interface for it.

                <p>
                  Data has become extremely important to me lately in my coding studies,
                  but I've been using Pandas along with the Juypter Notebook and Matplotlib
                  to create my visualizations.  It's super easy and fast, but, I wanted to get
                  back to JS a little bit, so for this project I levereaged Plotly.js to create
                  a line chart comparing completion percentage for my two classes.  The graphing part was
                  easy, it was making the backend on Google Apps Script that was super hard.
                  I still need to hook up an update route.

                <p>
                  After some time away, I really wanted to get back into React and review
                  all the basics.  So, I created a tiny little math game.  I think it could
                  be pretty useful for quizzing over the Pythagorean Triples.  Of course those
                  are very useful :-)  I'd like to add styling at some point, but once again,
                  that's not what I particulary enjoy.

                <p>
                  This project was a follow up to my rock paper scissors game.
                  I really enjoyed working with events in Socket IO and wanted
                  to do a lot more with my React interface.  This also utilizes
                  the react router.  The major improvement over the rock paper scissors
                  server is using rooms instead a list, so the server can host more than
                  one game at a time and players can join the game they want, as
                  opposed to get getting the next random player.  The logic is rough,
                  I did quite a few vanilla Javascript projects after this to get
                  better with that.

                  This project was all about leveraging a multidimensional array
                  to predict collisions with walls and targets.  Previously I used
                  the distance formula, but found checking array values to immensely
                  easier for something that is so simple.  This is probably one of my
                  favorite projects.  I left it alone for a little while, and came back
                  to finish it up.

				  This was the first app written without a framework.  It
				  is done in vanilla Javascript.  I didn't even use jQuery!
				  I did this project to help myself understand the language better,
				  especially objects and the "this" keyword.  I also was able to utilize
				  some mocha unit testing with the chai assert framework.  This was made
				  possible by separating the UI from the game logic.  Functionality is
				  tied together by emitter events.  Also, notice use of the canvas element
				  to provide the game graphics.  Admittedly, look and feel is not my strong
				  point... yet :-)

                  This was originally done with EJS rendered template views,
                  but I have recently refactored it into a single page app with
                  React Router.  It still needs major styling improvements, but
                  it is ready for use in the next school year.  I will be able to
                  add quizzes via a command line interface, students will be able to
                  view and take the most recent and active quizzes.  It gives instant
                  feedback and the ability to delete low grades, since the primary
                  purpose is to give them rapid feedback.  If you want to peek about use

                  The first web app I did was written with Django.  I wrote it in order
                  to faciliate an elective class at school, where kids searched the
                  campus for hidden geocaches according to coordinates listed on the website.
                  It was pretty much like a blog, with posts and comments.  It had one added
                  feature, which was the ability to generate a GPX file for the geocache, which
                  is just a XML document.  This site is no longer live.
